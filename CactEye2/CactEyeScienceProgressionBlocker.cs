 *  This file is part of CactEye Telescopes.
 *  This code will re-proxy the stored GameEvents.OnScienceReceived for the ProgressTracker (KSP World First Events) Science progress on celestialbodies
 *  where the science subject contains the string : "CactEyePlanitary". This stops world first progress registering a unmanned science/visited event
 *  for celestial bodies that we take pictures of with a CactEye space telescope. The reason for doing is, is so that the stock contract generator will still generate
 *  "go visit planet x" or "explore planet x" contracts for celestial bodies that have had their picture taken.
